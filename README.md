# diagnosing-breast-cancer

Learning to train different machine learning models (including a neural network) to predict whether a breast cancer sample is malignant or benign.

The different steps involved to complete this project are:
- Download data and load it into a Jupyter Notebook
- Import useful libraries like pandas and sci-kit learn
- Clean the data
- Divide the model for training and testing
- Quantify the performance of the model
